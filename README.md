# Ghostman Game project
Implemented using HTML, JavaScript, React JS, SCSS and Vite

## Short description
This is a simple variation of the classic word game Hangman, where player needs to guess a randomly generated word, one letter at a time.

Each letter is masked, displayed as an underscore ( `_` ). When the player has guessed a letter, every instance of this letter is uncovered. To win the game, player needs to uncover all letters before they run out of chances.

## Features to implement and new ideas
* render game status by swiching images of Ghost and displaying messages
* mark buttons that were used but did not match (toggle modifier class "--wrong")
* when (or before) the game starts, get random word
  * either using 3rd party API (e.g. "Wordnik") or from a custom database of words and phrases
* add styling for mobile version
* use computer keyboard to guess the letters
* add header and/or footer to display project's info, like version, copyrights, etc.
* add another language and allow switching between them before the game starts
